#FACS-Fast ACcess System
abs()"deleted due to uncompability with cross platform"
how to write
##abs(file name)
it will find the absolute path of the file that you write on
the bracket...that's all what it have...maybe

takeline<Mode::Offset>(vector<std::streampos>)
how to write
##Facs::takeline<Mode::Offset>::index(streampos type vector)
this function is use to get the offset of every line(first byte of line)
note:this is a struct,not a method
##it's has 2 another version
<Mode::Text> to get data of every line in file but does not get offset,use string vector
<Mode::Full> to get data,offset of every line and use struct Fidx(full index) in facs.hpp,also you can acess the data,pos in that struct via a streampos,string object(sample is r) r.pos,r.data(pos is streampos,data is string)

rol() aka read on-line
how to write
##rol(a iterator from vector have been takeline or use your own,string)
read on a specified line,consider using takelined vector

write()
how to write
##write(data want to write)
it will write on a .log file and that it what do you want on 
that,i'll rename it as write because it look the same with 
the write function

how to write
##read(file name)
only read no encode file but in the actual release it will

write()
